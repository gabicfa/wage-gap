# Wage Gap

## Problem

In this project, the objective is to analyze whether it is possible to find evidence of wage discrimination between
men and women.
For this study, it was considered only individuals who worked at one job, with a formal contract, and a family “reference person”.

## Database

The <pes2013P1> database is a filter obtained from PNAD 2013 that eliminates many variables. However, it preserves all 362,555 individuals.
